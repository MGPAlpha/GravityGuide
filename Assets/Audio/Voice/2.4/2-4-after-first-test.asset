  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Hazard, how many more test rooms are there until she gets
    to the delivery shaft?

    <t=135>[Hazard]: Uhhh, I think three?

    <t=138>[Asimov]:
    Hazard, when did you have time to build this many new tests? How did I not know
    about it?

    <t=142>[Hazard]: You seemed busy, so I didn''t want to add to
    your workload with the management for the expansion.

    <t=147>[Asimov]: Hazard,
    that''s my entire job! I''m supposed to know about these things!

    [Asimov]:
    Sorry about this, Alexis. I didn''t expect this to be so complicated.

    <t=155>[Hazel]:
    Don''t worry though, you''re doing great! Just be careful with that crate!'
