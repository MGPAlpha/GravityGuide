  subtitles: '[Hazel]: Oh yeah, that crate is acting weird. Why is it jerking around
    like that?

    <t=92>[Asimov]: We''re not sure, but we''re going to find out.
    Alexis, now we need you to take the crate to a delivery shaft for the Hazardous
    Materials Lab.

    <t=100>The path should be pretty straightforward, just go
    to your right from here. Make sure to keep the crate with you!'
