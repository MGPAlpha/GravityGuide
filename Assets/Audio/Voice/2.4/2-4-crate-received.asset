  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Alright, just a moment and... Ok! The crate has arrived in
    the lab. I''ll log into one of the drones in there to try to get the crate open.

    <t=196>If
    anything goes wrong, it should be contained to just that lab.

    <t=201>[Asimov]:
    Ok... The drone is on... Navigating to the crate.

    <t=204>...

    <t=207>[Asimov]:
    Got it. Opening.... now.

    <t=210>[Asimov]: Oh...

    [Hazard]: Well, would
    you look at that!

    <t=213>[Hazel]: Oh my god.. is that... a CAT?!

    [Hazel]:
    Oh my goodness she''s so cute! Haz, can we keep her??

    <t=220>[Asimov]: Hazel,
    I''m not sure we have the budget for a cat.

    <t=225>[Hazel]: Sure we do!
    Besides, I''ve already named her, so we have to keep her!

    <t=229>[Hazard]:
    What''s the name?

    [Hazel]: Mel!

    <t=231>[Hazard]: Ah, short for Melanie?

    <t=234>[Hazel]:
    No, short for Watermelon!

    <t=236>[Asimov]: Fine, I guess. She can be our
    lab cat.

    <t=239>[Hazel]: Yay! I''m gonna go get her from the lab. I''ll
    be back soon.

    <t=243>[Asimov]: Well Alexis, thanks for helping us out with
    that, even if that crate turned out not to be quite as dangerous as we thought.

    <t=250>If
    you continue to your right, you should get back on track with the last few tests
    we have for you.'
