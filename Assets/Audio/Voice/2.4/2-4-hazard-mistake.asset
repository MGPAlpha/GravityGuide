  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Oh shoot, I totally forgot! I had this area remodeled into
    some new test rooms.

    <t=110>[Asimov]: What?! Why aren''t they on the map?

    <t=114>[Hazard]:
    Oh come on, Asimov. Nobody has the time to keep stuff like that updated!

    <t=118>[Asimov]:
    You could have at least mentioned you were remodeling this area! *I* could have
    updated the map!

    <t=122>[Hazard]: Sorry, must''ve slipped my mind.

    <t=125>[Asimov]:
    Nevermind, we can discuss this later. Alexis, you''ll just have to find a way
    though these tests with the crate.
