  subtitles: '[Hazel]: Oh, hi guys! Alexis, Haz and Dr. Asimov are back! Did you
    guys figure out what was up with that crate?

    <t=12>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]:
    Actually, that''s what we came back up for. Lenny found this really strange crate
    in storage.

    <t=17>It keeps moving around with sudden, jerky movements, and
    it''s making weird noises. We think it might be dangerous, so we didn''t want
    to get too close.

    <t=24>[Hazel]: Oh, that doesn''t sound good. What did
    you do with it?

    <t=29>[David Hazard]: Well, nothing yet. See, our hazmat
    team is currently on a team building retreat in the Bahamas, so we can''t get
    them to deal with it.

    <t=35>So, we got to thinking, and we realized that
    the Gravipod is actually pretty well suited for dealing with something that''s
    potentially dangerous.

    <t=44>It''s blast resistant, radiation resistant,
    the whole works.

    <t=49>[Asimov]: So, we were thinking, what if Alexis could
    use the Gravipod to help bring the crate to the Hazardous Materials Lab, where
    we could safely inspect it?

    <t=56>[Hazard]: Alexis, could you help us out
    with that? The Gravipod is really the only way we can deal with this right now,
    so it''d be a huge favor.

    <t=64>[Asimov]: I can reroute you to a transport
    room where I can send the crate so you can pick it up. Let''s get going, to your
    right.'
