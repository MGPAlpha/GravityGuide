  subtitles: '[Asimov]: She''s exited the atmosphere. Still on trajectory. She should
    land perfectly in the moonbase''s landing zone.

    <t=363>[Hazard]: What''s
    her ETA?

    <t=365>[Asimov]: About T-minus three hours, given hers and the
    moon''s current trajectories. She''ll only have three hours to get to the signal
    amplifier.

    <t=372>[Hazel]: What do we do in the meantime?

    <t=375>[Asimov]:
    Well, Alexis should get some rest. She''ll need it for what lies ahead. As for
    us, we''ve got three hours to kill. Any ideas?

    <t=384>[Hazard]: Ooh! We
    could play Scrabble!

    [Hazel]: Oh, that sounds fun.

    <t=388>[Asimov]:
    Sure why not. I''ll go get the board from storage.

    <t=391>[Hazard]: Nice!
    I swear, this time I''ll finally find a way to use the word "quizzaciously"!

    <t=397>[Hazel]:
    Alexis, feel free to get some rest. We''ll wake you when it''s time for you to
    land.'
