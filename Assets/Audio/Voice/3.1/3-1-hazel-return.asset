  subtitles: '[Hazel Marsh]: I''m back, and I brought Mel! You guys will love her,
    she''s the sweetest thing.

    <t=112>[Hazel]: Also, were you guys being serious
    about the whole... moon thing?

    <t=118>[Asimov]: (lying) What? Hazel what
    are you talking about? The moon is fine! Nothing''s wrong and if it was it''s
    definitely not our fault.

    <t=125>[Hazel]: Doctor, the intercom was on for
    that whole conversation. I could hear the whole thing. Alexis probably could
    too.

    [Asimov]: Oh god.

    <t=134[Asimov]: Okay, Alexis? Hey, so you might
    have heard over the intercom that the moon might be on a bit of a collision course
    with the Earth.

    <t=142>While I know that probably sounds pretty concerning,
    I want you to know we''re gonna get everything under control soon, so don''t
    worry.

    <t=149>[Hazard]: Does that mean you have a plan?

    <t=152>[Asimov]:
    Well, no. But we''re all smart here! I''m sure we can come up with something!

    [Hazel]:
    Any ideas?

    <t=159>[Hazard]: No.

    [Asimov]: Also no.

    <t=162>[Hazel]:
    Great, we''re all gonna die.

    <t=165>[Hazard]: Wait, actually I might have
    an idea.

    [Asimov]: What is it?

    <t=170>[Hazard]: Well, about a decade
    ago, when we were first starting to develop gravity manipulation tech, one of
    the first things we used it to do was actually go to the moon.

    It seemed
    like the obvious choice, you know?

    <t=182>[Asimov]: Yeah, I''ve seen the
    old files for the moonbase, but it''s gonna crash into the planet soon. How does
    that help us?

    <t=187>[Hazard]: Well, once we got there, we actually got
    a contract from NASA to help them with some of their operations. Namely, we built
    a signal amplifier inside the moon.

    <t=196>It uses the natural resonance
    of the moon rock to produce a much stronger broadcast than anything we can make
    on earth. They were using it to amplify the broadcasts they were sending out
    to try to look for alien life.

    <t=206>Of course, they stopped that project
    once the 2013 Incident happened.

    <t=210>[Hazel]: The 2013 incident?

    <t=213>[Hazard]:
    Oh don''t worry about that, just a little alien encounter. Didn''t end well,
    but we had it covered.

    <t=218>[Hazard]: Anyway, that amplifier isn''t being
    used for anything anymore, but it''s still there at the center of the moon.

    I
    think, if we could connect the Gravipod''s gravitational manipulators to the
    signal amplifier, then we could use its amplified field to redirect the moon.

    <t=233>[Asimov]:
    That actually sounds like it could work, but who would we send? None of us have
    enough experience in the Gravipod to pull that off!

    <t=241>[Hazel]: Well,
    Alexis might, right? I mean, she''s gotten past every test we''ve given her.

    <t=247>[Asimov]:
    I hate to admit it, but you might be right. Alexis might be the only one who
    can fix this.

    <t=253>[Hazard]: Alexis, I''m sorry I have to ask you this,
    but can we send you to the moon? You might be the only one that can prevent the
    total destruction of life on Earth.

    <t=262>[Asimov]: Hazard, she still has
    no microphone.

    <t=266>[Hazard]: Oh. Well, I''ll just have to take it on
    faith that you''ll do it. Alright everyone, lets get her to the moon!

    (pause)

    <t=273>[Asimov]:
    Alright Alexis, I''m gonna reroute you through the vents again. This time, we''re
    gonna take you to the launch room.

    <t=277>After the moonbase project was
    discontinued, we converted this room to use for testing material collisions,
    but we should still be able to get you to the moon. Just follow the vent until
    you get to an opening.'
