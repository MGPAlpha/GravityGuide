  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Uh-huh... Okay.... Yeah I''ll take a look. Thanks Lenny.

    <t=19>[Asimov]:
    Hazard, that was Lenny in engineering on the phone. He says he found a bug in
    the code for the quantum targeting system that may have caused all our gravity
    manipulators to target the moon, instead of random stars.

    <t=32>It was apparently
    just a less-than versus greater-than symbol bug, and he''s fixed it, but it may
    have already impacted the moon''s orbit. Can you run an analysis of its orbit,
    just to make sure we''re good?

    <t=42>[David Hazard]: Sure, I can run that
    real quick, just gimme a sec.

    <t=45>...

    <t=48>[Hazard]: Hey, Doctor?
    You might wanna see this.

    [Asimov]: What?

    <t=53>[Hazard]: Well... It
    says the moon''s orbit has been destabilized...

    and it''s on just a little
    bit of a collision course...

    <t=60>with the Earth.

    <t=63>[Asimov]:
    I''m sorry WHAT?! Haz, that''s a total extinction event! That''d be the end!
    Of everything!

    <t=68>[Hazard]: Well, I''m not so sure about *total* extinction.
    Some types of bacteria might survive!

    <t=74>[Asimov]: Hazard I don''t care
    about some bacteria, we''re humans! The entire planet would be turned into a
    primordial soup of magma! This is an emergency!

    <t=81>[Asimov]: There''s
    gotta be a way we can fix this. There has to be. How long until impact?

    [Hazard]:
    The computer says...

    <t=88>6 hours.

    <t=90>[Asimov]: SIX HOURS!? Oh
    god I can''t be responsible for the complete annihilation of the human race!
    I can''t! I need a moment to think.

    <t=99>Don''t tell Hazel or Alexis about
    this, we might still be able to fix this. Just give me a moment.'
