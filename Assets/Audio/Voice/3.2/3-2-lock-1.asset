  subtitles: '[Asimov]: It looks like there''s some kind of lock set up on the door.
    Haz, do you have any idea how she''s supposed to open the door?

    <t=76>[Hazard]:
    Oh, it''s been a while. I don''t remember what the code was at all. Let me check
    some of the old blueprints...

    <t=84>[Hazard]: There''s a note in the blueprints
    that says "lock is 21", but the lock is a bunch of on/off switches, so I don''t
    really see how that makes sense.
