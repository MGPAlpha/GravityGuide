  subtitles: '[Hazel Marsh]: Alexis? Can you hear me? You''re almost to the moon,
    so get ready for landing.

    <t=6>[David Hazard]: You shouldn''t need to do
    anything during landing, of course. You''re on track to fall directly into the
    base.

    <t=12>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]: Alright it''s almost time. Everyone,
    be ready. Alexis, you''re going to fall through a gravity field that reverses
    your gravity back toward the Earth,

    <t=20>but your momentum should keep
    you going enough for you to get into the base and have a barrier close behind
    you.


    <t=24>[Asimov]: Alright, it''s time.'
