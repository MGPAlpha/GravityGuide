  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Oh, that''s right. I forgot we sealed the core sector shaft
    when we left the moonbase. Hmmm.

    <t=154>[Hazard]: Oh! The field disruptor
    should be in the next room over. We installed it as a safeguard in case we needed
    to disrupt a disintegrator if it ever malfunctioned and became dangerous.

    <t=164>If
    you activate the field disruptor though, it should temporarily disable the light
    barrier, long enough to let you get through.

    <t=170>You''ll have to get
    back to the room quickly though, before the barrier reasserts itself.'
