  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Haz, what are all those crates doing there?

    <t=32>[Hazard]:
    Oh yeah, forgot about those. They''re... lets call them a makeshift security
    measure. Leftover from the 2013 Incident.

    <t=42>[Hazel Marsh]: What are
    they there for?

    <t=44>[Hazard]: Oh don''t worry about that, it''s a bit
    secret.

    But don''t worry, it''s totally safe back there now.

    <t=49>[Asimov]:
    Oh don''t tell me she has to get through those to get to the control room!

    <t=52>[Hazard]:
    Yeah, it''s behind there.

    [Hazel]: Well, can they be moved?

    <t=56>[Hazard]:
    Not with anything Alexis has access to. We set up that barricade to be as impenetrable
    as possible. She''s not gonna be able to move it.

    <t=63>[Hazel]: So what
    do we do?

    [Hazard]: Well.... I don''t know. I had kinda forgotten this was
    here.

    <t=69>[Asimov]: Wait, Hazard. Those are just regular crates, right?

    [Hazard]:
    Yeah, why?

    <t=75>[Asimov]: Well, couldn''t we just disintegrate them?

    <t=78>[Hazard]:
    Well... I guess but... they''d have to pass through a disintegration field, which
    would be difficult considering they can''t move.

    <t=86>[Asimov]: Actually,
    I may have a way around that.

    [Hazard]: Oh?

    <t=90>[Asimov]: According
    to the blueprints, the remote override switches for this area of the base should
    be nearby here.

    <t=95>If Alexis can activate those three switches, I think
    I can reroute some power to make a kind of makeshift disintegrator to destroy
    the blockage.

    <t=100>[Hazel]: That''s great!

    <t=102>[Asimov]: Now Alexis,
    I need you to get to the three switches and activate each one. Once you''ve done
    that, get back to the central room, and I''ll prepare the power diversion.'
