  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Now, you should see a sensor that looks like its connected
    to the door to the passageway.

    However, I''ve rerouted its signal so that,
    when you activate the sensor, all of those crates should get disintegrated.

    <t=137>[Hazard]:
    This could be a bit dangerous, so be careful.

    <t=139>[Asimov]: Okay. Whenever
    you''re ready, activate the sensor.'
