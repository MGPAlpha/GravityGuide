  subtitles: '[David Hazard]: Welcome to the core sector of the moonbase. Fun fact:
    the core sector isn''t actually at the core of the moon, it''s just the deepest
    part of the base.

    <t=10>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]: Well, the deepest livable
    section of the base anyway. The signal amplifier actually extends all the way
    to the core of the moon, but that''s just the tech.

    We don''t need to get
    that deep, just get to the control room.

    <t=19>[Hazard]: Follow this path
    to the right, then up, and you should get to a big room. From there, a passage
    to the right should lead to the control room.'
