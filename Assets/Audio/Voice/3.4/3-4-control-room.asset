  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Alexis, welcome to the control room. Above you is the primary
    signal input array. That''s what we''ll use to send the signal from your gravity
    field to the amplifier.

    <t=17>[Hazard]: Before we can connect to the amplifier,
    we need to activate it. You should see three crate sensors in the room. Put a
    crate into each of them to turn the amplifier on.

    <t=26>[Dr. Nicolette Asimov]:
    There should be a few rooms branching out from the control room where you can
    get some crates.'
