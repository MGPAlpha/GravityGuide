  subtitles: '[Hazard]: Okay, you''re on the path to one of the emergency escape
    routes. If you just keep pressing forward, you should be able to reach an exit.

    <t=115>[Asimov]:
    Haz, it looks like the moon is on track to escape Earth''s orbit, and soon after
    that escape our communication range. If she doesn''t get out of there soon, we''ll
    lose our connection and she won''t be able to get back.

    <t=124>[Hazard]:
    Then she''d better be quick.'
