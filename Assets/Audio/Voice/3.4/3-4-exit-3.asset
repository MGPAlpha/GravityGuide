  subtitles: '[Hazard]: I''ve got something! The data''s coming in. According to
    the calculations.... she''s on a path toward the Earth!

    <t=156>It''s not
    an exact path of course, but once she''s more in range we can adjust her trajectory
    more precisely to make her land squarely inside Gravitonix''s landing bay. She''s
    gonna make it home.

    <t=166>[Hazel]: Oh thank gosh I was terrified!

    [Asimov]:
    That''s good to hear.

    <t=171>[Hazard]: How about you, Alexis? How do you
    feel after saving the Earth itself from destruction?

    <t=175>...

    <t=177>[Asimov]:
    Haz. Still no microphone. She can''t answer.

    <t=180>[Hazard]: Oh, that''s
    right. Well she can tell us all about it once she''s back on the ground and out
    of that pod.

    <t=186>[Hazard]: Alexis, it''s gonna be a few hours before
    you''re back on the ground. But just hang in there, and we''ll have you home
    in no time.

    <t=194>[Hazel]: So I guess we have some time to kill again,
    huh?

    [Asimov]: It seems like we do.

    <t=199>[Hazard]: You know what?
    Why don''t we see what''s on the radio? I wonder if anyone has noticed that the
    moon is gone.

    <t=204>(radio static)

    <t=210>[Radio Announcer]: ...And
    for those of you just tuning in, boy has it been one heck of a news day. In case
    you missed it, earlier today we started getting reports that people all across
    the country, and in fact the world, were seeing the moon grow much larger in
    the sky.

    <t=220>In fact, it eventually got so big as to completely block
    out the sky in some places.

    <t=225>Many viewed this as a sign of impending
    doom, as it seemed that the moon would crash into the Earth, immolating us all
    in an instant. I myself truly believed this to be the end of it all.

    <t=233>[Radio]:
    I am pleased to report, however, that this cosmic disaster appears to have been
    averted.

    <t=238>Just when we though it was all over, the moon began to shrink
    in the sky, even faster than it appeared, until eventually completely disappearing.

    <t=245>[Radio]:
    We''ve reached out to the scientists at NASA for comment, but it seems they''re
    just as baffled as anyone. According to them, the moon''s orbit experienced some
    sudden degeneration, pulling it onto a collision course with the Earth.

    <t=255>Apparently
    though, before it could make contact, some unseen force suddenly propelled it
    away from the Earth and completely out of Earth''s gravitational influence.

    <t=263>They
    say it''s on track to pass by Saturn in the next 17 hours, and to completely
    exit the solar system within the week. They could offer no explanation for why
    this would happen.

    <t=271>[Radio]: It does seem pretty clear to me, though,
    how this happened. The only reasonable explanation for something like this is
    a supernatural one.

    <t=278>Clearly, humanity has angered the sky god, who
    has taken our beloved moon from us as punishment. The only way we might have
    the moon returned is through a debt of service to the sky god.

    <t=287>That
    is why, effective immediately, I am resigning my position as newscaster in order
    to fully devote my life in service to the god of the sky.

    <t=294>I encourage
    all of you listening to join me in my devotion.

    <t=297>For the last time
    on air, this is Ray Diovois, signing off.

    <t=301>(radio static)

    <t=308>[Hazard]:
    Ummm...

    <t=310>[Hazard]: Well fu@#'
