  subtitles: '[Asimov]: Okay, okay. That was a little more forceful than we had anticipated.
    It looks like the moon is now moving away from the Earth at a speed of... very

    <t=100>[Hazard]:
    Alexis, we''re going to make a bit of an emergency escape here. I''m opening
    a door at the top of the room. I need you to exit through there if you want to
    make it back to Earth.'
